This section contains the calendars for the Fall 2005 and Spring 2006 semesters. The calendars are presented both in [PDF format](#pdf), as well as [HTML format](#html). Due to the complexity of the calendars, detailed explanations of the course format and a [calendar key](#calendar_key) are provided prior to the presentation of the calendars.

Two-Semester Overview
---------------------

Students who complete Unified Engineering are credited with four classes: two for the Fall semester and two for the Spring semester. However, each pair of courses is seamlessly integrated. In the Fall, 16.01 and 16.02 are presented as one large course. In the Spring, 16.03 and 16.04 are also presented as a large course, but nonetheless singular.

Parallel Teaching
-----------------

Over the course of each semester, students engage in seven disciplines of study, listed below. Each discipline is taught for a fraction of the semester, through a series of lectures. When one discipline concludes, students are quizzed and begin a new discipline.

Unified Concepts, Systems and Labs Lectures
-------------------------------------------

A small number of Unified Concepts lectures occur throughout the Fall semester. They do not have an associated quiz. These lectures pertain to coursewide topics, and may be technical (e.g. a review of vectors) or non-technical (e.g. a mid-term feedback session). Weekly Systems and Labs lectures offer instructions for upcoming Laboratory activities and projects, and also do not have quizzes.

Lectures
--------

There are two lectures held on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Only one lecture is held on Tuesday. The second lecture on Thursday is usually for Systems and Labs.

Recitations
-----------

Students attend two recitation sessions per week; one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. Recitations are held twice on each of those days, to offer scheduling flexibility and reduce class size. Unlike lectures, recitations are generally not used to introduce new topics. Rather, these are an opportunity for discussion and application of recently-introduced lecture topics.

Changes between Fall and Spring
-------------------------------

In the Spring, Thermodynamics is replaced by Propulsion, and the other disciplines continue with advanced topics.

Quizzes
-------

Most quizzes are scheduled during lecture sessions. However, the final two disciplines each semester are examined during MIT's final exam week. This occurs after the regular class schedule has concluded.
