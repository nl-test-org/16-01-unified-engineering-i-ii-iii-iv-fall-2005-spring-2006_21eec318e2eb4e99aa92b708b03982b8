description: This lab is designed to provide you with an opportunity to verify that
  simple beam theory provides a good prediction of the deformation and stresses in
  a beam and hence to explore the underlying assumptions. The laboratory consists
  of three related experiments, each of which probes one of the predictions of beam
  theory.
